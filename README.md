A fork of C3C0's GravityBox to support many more phones and ROMs

# Why fork?

GravityBox chooses to be incompatible with virtually all phones and ROMs other than stock Nexus, just so that reboots aren't required for some settings changes to take effect (see the Compatibility section of [its XDA thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v5-0-0alpha-tweak-box-t3037566) for more details). I use other phones and custom ROMs, and I'm more than willing to reboot once in a while if it means having all of these features, so I'm forking to give myself that ability.
